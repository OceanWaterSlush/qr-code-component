## My process

### Built with

- Vite & deployed with Vercel
- React
- TypeScript
- Sass (SCSS Syntax)

### What I learned

- When deploying your Vite application, make sure to place any image files used in your code in the `public` directory or else they won't show in production environments

### Continued development

- If I'm to use Vite again, try to use SCSS modules (e.g., `import styles from './Card.scss'`)
- Perhaps write unit tests and integrate CI/CD

### Useful resources

- [Scaffolding a Vite Project](https://vitejs.dev/guide/) - This official Vite documentation will get you started at scaffolding a Vite project in a few seconds
- [Using .scss Files in a Vite Project](https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html) - This official Vite documentation will get you started with CSS Pre-processors in a few seconds
